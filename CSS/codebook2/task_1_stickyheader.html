            <p>As part of my web development learning journey, I recently completed a practice project focused on implementing a Sticky Header using CSS.
This project helped me understand how to create a fixed navigation layout that stays at the top of the page when scrolling — a common and user-friendly feature in modern web design. I used core technologies like HTML and CSS, applying key concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅position: fixed to keep the header in place</li>
    <li>✅ z-index to ensure it stays above other elements</li>
   <li>✅ Inline navigation menu styled with display: inline-block and flexbox</li>
   <li>✅ Scrollable page content with proper padding to prevent overlap</li>
</ul>

    <p>I’m currently two months into a government-sponsored web development program affiliated with Dr. Bosun Tijani, where I’ve been building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python — all with the goal of becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

This Sticky Header project is just one of many steps on my journey, and I'm excited to keep growing, learning, and sharing what I build!</p>
