            Hello and welcome! I’m thrilled to have you here exploring my personal space on the internet. This site is a reflection of who I am — my passions, my projects, and my journey so far.
            I’ve developed strong skills in web development, including <span style="color: red;">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design</span>. I'm also familiar with version control using Git and have a basic understanding of frontend technologies.
           <p> Beyond technical skills, I value soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and adaptability. I believe these are just as important as coding when working in teams and building meaningful solution. </p>
